# Lab: Menu-driven calculator 

Practice `if` chains vs. `switch`, input validation, and short-circuiting.

------

## Learning outcomes

By the end, students can:

- **Apply** `if`/`else` and `switch` to implement menu options.
- **Analyze** input to validate numeric values and reject errors.
- **Analyze** edge cases such as division by zero.
- **Apply** `enum class` for type-safe menu choices.
- **Analyze** conditions using short-circuiting and scope control.
- **Create** a complete interactive calculator integrating input, decisions, and arithmetic.

## Prerequisite

- Decision and switch statements

## What do you need to complete this exercise?

- Submit your responses in a Markdown file on GitHub, and include a brief reflection on the challenges you encountered during the lab.
- Ensure that all code included in the Markdown file runs without errors. Refer to [Submitting Your Assignment Using GitHub](https://sdccd-edu.zoom.us/rec/share/F4rK6ZABMXlRn4aGlZ9P005e-iRKwq8rr9KuawDoJ77TdkybKU2tpf4l4QSe113g.ut4jpVaqaPY0oI7b?startTime=1725121532000) for detailed instructions.
- Record a video of yourself explaining the code. Use a desktop or laptop to write and demonstrate the code, making sure that both your screen and your image are visible. If you do not have a laptop, you may borrow one from the library for the semester.

### Requirements

1. Show menu: add, subtract, multiply, divide, quit. Use `enum class` and `switch`.
2. Read two `double` operands with validation; reject non-numeric input.
3. For divide: detect division by zero using `if (b == 0)`; keep the program running.
