## Course description
This course provides an introduction to programming using the C++ language. Students will learn fundamental programming concepts including data types, operators, control structures, functions, arrays, pointers, and file handling. 
Emphasis is placed on structured and object-oriented programming techniques to design, implement, and test programs. The course also covers the organization of standard Input/Output (I/O) classes and the use of modular program design. 
By the end of the course, students will be able to apply C++ programming skills to solve computational problems. This course is intended for computer science majors and students seeking a solid foundation in computer programming.
