# Syllabus (CISC-192 C/C++ Programming) Honors Contract
__This syllabus is for Honors Contract Students only__ 
## Welcome to the course!
My name is Dr. Danish Khan, and I am excited to begin this educational journey with all of you! Together, we will create a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone’s ideas are valued and respected. Your active participation will enrich our learning community, and I look forward to getting to know each of you. Let’s make this school year a meaningful experience filled with growth, learning, and lasting positive memories!

## Course description
This course provides an introduction to programming using the C++ language. Students will learn fundamental programming concepts including data types, operators, control structures, functions, arrays, pointers, and file handling. 
Emphasis is placed on structured and object-oriented programming techniques to design, implement, and test programs. The course also covers the organization of standard Input/Output (I/O) classes and the use of modular program design. 
By the end of the course, students will be able to apply C++ programming skills to solve computational problems. This course is intended for computer science majors and students seeking a solid foundation in computer programming.

Students enrolled in the Honors Contract are expected to engage in independent research, complete additional assignments, and participate in one-on-one online meetings with the professor. They will also take part in Work-Based Learning activities, which include connecting with career services, enhancing resume writing and interview skills, and networking with professionals in their field of study.
